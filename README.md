# WP Pager plugin for WordPress
WP Pager is a WordPress plugin for displaying images in a form of a restaurant menu. The main advantage of such plugin is that you can turn pages of the menu by swiping on mobile and desktop devices.

The main purpose of this plugin is to give users a filling of a real restaurant menu where they can turn pages and see the whole menu.

## Development
> [!NOTE]
> If you use [🐳 Docker](https://app.docker.com/) instead of [🦦 Podman](https://podman.io/), just replace `podman-compose` with `docker compose`, and `podman` with `docker` in code examples below.

### Build the Image
```bash
podman-compose build
```

### Start a Container
```bash
podman-compose up -d
```

Wait until all containers will be up and running. Visit `http://localhost:8080`. If you see the WordPress installation page, you are good to go. If you see an error, wait a bit more until database will spin up.

### Enter Running Container
To enter the running container you can use this command:
```bash
podman-compose exec app bash
```

Inside the container, you can navigate to `/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/wp-pager` directory to run `npm` and `composer` commands.

### Copy `vendor` and `node_modules`
If you don't have NPM and Composer installed on your machine (like myself), you can copy `vendor` and `node_modules` from the running container to get proper intellisense to your editor:
```bash
podman cp wp-pager-app:/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/wp-pager/vendor plugin/ && \
podman cp wp-pager-app:/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/wp-pager/node_modules plugin/
```

### Destroy Container
After you are done working on a project, you can remove networks and running containers by running this command:
```bash
podman-compose down
```
