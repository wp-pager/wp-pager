# WP Pager plugin for WordPress

 Welcome to WP Pager, the free WordPress plugin that empowers you to showcase your images in stunning album or gallery format. Our plugin boasts a sleek and user-friendly interface that enables you to effortlessly create and manage image galleries with ease.

While uploading images to your WordPress site may be simple, presenting them in a captivating gallery or album format can be challenging. That's why WP Pager was developed to offer an intuitive solution for creating visually impressive galleries of images.
